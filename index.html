    Some friendships don’t begin with fireworks; they begin with a ping, a late reply, a shared doubt, a ‘Hlo’ at odd hours, an “Answer please” at dawn, a code snippet when the syntax won’t cooperate. In files and folders, we found a bond among OS programs and chi-square dreams, between SQL cheatsheets and DBMS streams, a project here, a confusion there, yet the story redeems. Who knew Graph Theory and UI/UX would stitch two minds through a screen, that a random ‘Gotilla’ or ‘Ha okk’ could hide a friendship so unseen? We’ve held each other’s 2 AM panic when deadlines turned nights into code, silly ‘Huu’ replies eased the load. We crossed through treasure hunts and moderation plans, through placement fears and secret ideas, through birthday wishes once sent on time and dreams that run bigger than college spans. If our chats were a timeline, they would flow like a GitHub repo with commit after commit, full of mistakes, fixes, pull requests, but never a push that ever quits. <span class="highlight">Somewhere in that flow, thank you for picking me for NeuroVision and for every push and idea that made me step in and stay in NISB — a branch in my college story I might have missed without you connecting the nodes, debugging the doubts, and making it all feel possible.</span> So here’s to Mahima — the solver, the helper, the one who laughs at ‘Huu’, who says ‘Yeah okay’, who sends the slides, the drive links, the docs, and makes the ordinary drift away. May your dreams compile without warnings, may your bugs resolve without delay, may your days be filled with coffee and confetti and nights with peace after work and play. This tale of ours, between syntax and sessions, between viva fears and placement confessions, is more than a chat — it’s a simple confession: I wish you joy beyond every dimension. So here’s to your birthday — let the happy echo like endless while loops that never go slow. May life gift you surprises better than code because Mahima, you’re the best to know.
